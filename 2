     <p>Car firms have invested heavily to turn Mexico into an export base<br>
         The main reasons are not the nearly-defunct <strong>North American <u>Free Trade Agreement</u></strong> or lower labour costs,<br>
     but rather Mexico’s four dozen free-trade agreements with other countries<br> 
    which allow it to export to almost half the world’s market for new cars tariff-free.<br>
     A longer-term force that could turn automotive supply chains upside down is electrification<br>
     The Edison Electric Institute, a think-tank, <br>
    estimates that the share of electric vehicles (evs) in new car sales in America will rise from 2% in 2018 to over 20% in 2030.<br>
     That could reduce trade in parts dramatically, since evs have many fewer moving parts than conventional cars.<br>
